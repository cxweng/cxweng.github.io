Hi, everyone! This is Chen-Xun Weng's homepage on the web!

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at School of Physics, Nanjing University, China. My supervisor is Prof. Zeng-Bing Chen, who is a physicist and is professional in the field of quantum information processing, Bell nonlocality and quantum machine learning. I have been working with him on quantum information theory and expolring quantum adavantages. My research interests include quantum information processing, quantum crypotography, quantum correlation, and some intriguing quantum advantages which are impossible to be seen in the classical world.

In my spare time, I enjoy the Game of Go and hold a 4 Dan Rank from the China Weiqi Association.
